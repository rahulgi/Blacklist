README:

This is a very simple extension for Google Chrome. When you find yourself on a website that is taking too much of your time, simply hit the Blacklist button in the upper right corner of Chrome and choose between blocking the entire domain or just the current URL (i.e., some sub-page). You will be blocked from visiting that domain or sub-page url while Blacklist remains active. To resume visiting any site or sub-page url blocked by Blacklist, you must visit the site, click the Blacklist extension button in the upper right corner of the browser, and then click the "unlist site" or "unlist url" button. If you chose "unlist site" then ALL restrictions for the entire domain will be lifted. If you chose "unlist url" and you had originally blocked only the current sub-age URL, then only the current sub-age restrictions will be removed. However, if you had blocked the entire domain, then the domain restrictions will be removed when you choose "unlist url". Note that you will be forced to wait for 15 seconds before any restrictions are removed and you will be redirected to the root url.
 
This extension is released for free in and can be installed directly from the Chrome store at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blacklist/jbpccandodannohfaoncogijbkfcmpgo?hl=en&gl=US.
Alternatively, to install this extension directly from the source, download the code from GitHub, extract it, and then add it to Chrome as detailed in step 4 of Create and Load Extensions on this page: http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.html.
 
To completely disable Blacklist, return to chrome://extensions and uncheck the box next to Blacklist.
